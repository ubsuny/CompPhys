    "It is also possible to perform manipulations of waveforms in the frequency domain. This has physical applications in low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters. Only certain frequencies are allowed in the frequency domain. Once transforming back into the time domain, there are observable effects on the waveform. You can remove high frequencies, low frequencies, or bands of frequencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this, we will look at a different dataset, the number of sunspots in the sun from [the Solar Influences Data Analysis Center](http://www.sidc.be/DATA/yearssn.dat). Sunspots are often accompanied by solar flares, which can affect temperatures on earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this dataset is often used by climate change deniers to therefore conclude that humans are not responsible for the warming planet. This dataset does not support the hypothesis quantitatively because the sun spot activity does not correlate with the global temperature anomaly. "
