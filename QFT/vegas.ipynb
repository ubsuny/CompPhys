    "Class :class:`vegas.Integrator` gives Monte Carlo estimates of arbitrary\n",
    "multidimensional integrals using the *vegas* algorithm\n",
    "(G. P. Lepage, J. Comput. Phys. 27 (1978) 192 and J. Comput. Phys. 439 (2021) 110386).\n",
    "The algorithm has two components.\n",
    "First an automatic transformation is applied to to the integration variables\n",
    "in an attempt to flatten the integrand. Then a Monte Carlo estimate of the\n",
    "integral is made using the  transformed variables. Flattening the integrand\n",
    "makes the integral easier and improves the estimate.  The transformation\n",
    "applied to the integration variables is optimized\n",
    "over several iterations of the algorithm: information about the integrand that\n",
    "is collected during one iteration is used to  improve the transformation used\n",
    "in the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo integration makes few assumptions about the\n",
    "integrand --- it needn't be analytic nor even continuous. This\n",
    "makes Monte Carlo integration unusually robust. It also makes it well suited\n",
    "for adaptive integration. Adaptive strategies are essential for\n",
    "multidimensional integration, especially in high dimensions, because\n",
    "multidimensional space is large, with  lots of corners, making it\n",
    "easy to lose important features in the integrand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo integration also provides efficient and reliable methods for\n",
    "estimating the\n",
    "accuracy of its results. In particular, each Monte Carlo\n",
    "estimate of an integral is a random number from a distribution\n",
    "whose mean is the correct value of the integral. This distribution is\n",
    "Gaussian or normal provided\n",
    "the number of integrand samples is sufficiently large.\n",
    "In practice we generate multiple\n",
    "estimates of the integral\n",
    "in order to verify that the distribution is indeed Gaussian.\n",
    "Error analysis is straightforward if the\n",
    "integral estimates are Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "The |vegas| algorithm has been in use for decades and implementations are\n",
    "available in many programming languages, including Fortran (the original\n",
    "version), C and C++. The algorithm used here is significantly improved over\n",
    "the original implementation, and that used in most other implementations.\n",
    "It uses two adaptive strategies: importance sampling, as in the original\n",
    "implementation, and adaptive stratified sampling, which is new. The \n",
    "new algorithm is described in G. P. Lepage, arXiv_2009.05112_ \n",
    "(J. Comput. Phys. 439 (2021) 110386).\n",
    "\n",
    ".. _arXiv_2009.05112: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05112\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a third adaptive strategy, adaptive re-stratification, that can \n",
    "be useful in very high dimensions. See :func:`vegas.restratify`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is written in Cython, so it is almost as fast as compiled Fortran or\n",
    "C, particularly when the integrand is also coded in Cython (or some other\n",
    "compiled language), as discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections describe how to use |vegas|. Almost every\n",
    "example shown is a complete code, which can be copied into a file\n",
