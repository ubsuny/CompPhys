    "Do your work in the notebook `Problem3/Problem3.ipynb`. Starting from the `CompPhys/PDEs/poisson.ipynb` notebook, use the Jacobi method with vectorization to compute the electrostatic potential due to an electric dipole with charge $q=10$ (i.e., there are two particles each of charge $q$), located at the center of a two-dimensional, grounded, square metal box of length $L=1$. The dipole should be parallel to the x-axis and have length $d=0.5$. \n",

    "Compare with the expected exact solution (i.e., the sum of the Coulomb potentials of the same two point charges) in free space. Only plot the solution within the same box of length $L=1$, even though the solution technically extends to infinity. Your exact solution should not contain any python loops, i.e., it should be vectorizable. \n"
