    "Consider a wire chamber that is infinitely long $z$ direction (so this reduces to a 2-dimensional problem), with $L_x=10$ and $L_y=2$. Compute the electrostatic potential for 5 wires running along the $z$ axis, equally spaced through a box, where all of the wires pass through the $x$ axis and the middle wire passes through the origin (i.e., the box spans $-5<x<5$, and the wires pass through the x-axis at $x=-4, -2, 0, 2, 4$). \n",

    "You will have to adjust the code to handle fixed potential instead of fixed charge. You'll also have to adjust the dimensions of the box.\n",

    "\n",
    "Compute the trajectory of a charged particle with charge $q=10$, mass $m=1$, initial position $(4,0)$, and initial velocity $(1,1)$. The potential from (4a) is your starting point; numerically evaluate the gradient to compute the electric field. Use the result as the acceleration for your derivative method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: you might run into trouble with adaptive schemes, because you are limited by the precision of your field calculation in (4a). Watch out for this and try to address any such issues!\n",
